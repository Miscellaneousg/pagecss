# Landing Page

This project is part of **The Odin Project's Foundations Course**, where the goal is to create an entire web page from scratch based on provided design mockups. This assignment tests the ability to translate visual designs into functional HTML and CSS code - no tutorials, no step-by-step guides - just figure it out.

## My Approach

- **Layout Strategy**: CSS Flexbox for all major positioning 
- **Section-by-Section**: Built incrementally (header → hero → info → quotes → CTA → footer) 
- **HTML-First**: Structure content before styling 
- **Debugging**: Used CSS outlines to visualize layout boundaries

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Technical Highlights:**
> - Paul Irish Box Sizing Method (Inheritance-based Box Sizing Reset)
> - Clean, readable, structured, maintainable HTML and CSS 
> - Vanilla HTML/CSS - no frameworks
> - Reusable card components
> - Semantic HTML5 structure for accessibility and SEO
